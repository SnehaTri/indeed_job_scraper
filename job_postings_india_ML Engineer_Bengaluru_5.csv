'Database test & tools development' group (part of the database server group of Server Technologies Division) works on the upcoming releases of Oracle database server, enveloping a wide range of technologies.My team works on test development for features like, Filesystems, Database In-memory, Space/Transaction management, Clustering, Backup/Recovery, Distributed database(Sharding), Storage technologies, Oracle Exadata and Oracle Database Appliance . 


The group with its state of the art development infrastructure and practices, helps shape technology that has been important for a large number of Fortune 2000 and other companies. The group foresees product usage scenarios, simulates real life problems, tests the forthcoming releases of Oracle database server and ensures that the customers get the highest quality database. 


Requirement: 


- B.Tech/M.Tech C.S. from a premier institution.- Candidates with good relational database fundamentals.- Web applications and desktop applications QA : Experience in Oracle DB, SQL.- Exposure to latest Oracle database features is desirable- Must have excellent hands on experience in test design, development and execution.- Experience in web automation using Selenium tools or other open source tools in PC or Mobile platform is required.- Product development QA, Product integration QA / automation web applications QA background.- Experience in using and configuration of RESTful Services and configuration of Oracle DB.- Excellent quality work, results oriented, Independent/Personal Drive, Good troubleshooting skills required.- Excellent communication (written and verbal), interpersonal and good team player.- Ability and enthusiasm to learn new technologies, adeptness in seeking solutions to complex problems.
