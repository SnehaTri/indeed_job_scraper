### **Who We Are****:**


 Stylumia believes in augmenting human intelligence in fashion and lifestyle retail for a better world. With relevant data and the right technology, people and businesses in fashion and lifestyle retail can solve challenging problems and change the world for the better. In 2015-16, when we looked at the available technology and solutions, we saw fashion forecasting and demand planning are either subjective in nature. We saw these methods do not solve the fundamental challenge in fashion trend spotting, trend forecast, and the business metrics of full-price sell-through continue to remain around the 50% mark creating over USD 750 billion/annum of wastage globally. The biggest wastage in the fashion industry is the one caused by ill-informed decision-making. We saw a need for a different kind of technology and approach, and we knew it would need a different kind of company to build it. That is why we formed Stylumia, a Deep Tech company solving fundamental retail challenges. Stylumia is a global innovation-first Retail AI organisation. We have products that impact the daily lives of varying multi-disciplinary personas across the value chain as we strive to help them eliminate wastage in the industry, by augmenting their decisions with consumer-backed insights.
